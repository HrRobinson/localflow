//! lfguard — the command guard engine for localflow.
//!
//! A pure sidecar: it decides whether a proposed shell command is safe to run,
//! blocking known-destructive commands (`git reset --hard`, `rm -rf /`, …)
//! while staying out of the way of everything else. No network, no coupling to
//! the localflow app.
//!
//! Pipeline: parse -> normalize -> pre-filter -> match (allow before deny) ->
//! decide. It **fails open**: on any malfunction (bad payload, oversize input,
//! regex timeout, pack-load failure) it ALLOWs and warns — a guard that wedges
//! autonomous agents gets disabled, so continuity wins.
