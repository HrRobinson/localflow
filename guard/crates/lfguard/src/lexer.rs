//! A real shell-ish tokenizer.
//!
//! This replaces the previous ad-hoc, regex/character-scan approach (a naive
//! `split_whitespace` "normalizer" plus a separate quote-aware character scan
//! for chaining-operator splitting). Two adversarial review rounds proved that
//! approach bypassable by quoting shapes it did not understand: an escaped
//! quote that does not close a string (`echo "a\""`), and adjacent-string
//! concatenation (`"/e"tc` is one argument, `/etc`). The fix is to tokenize
//! the whole command line **once**, correctly, and have everything downstream
//! (segmentation, argv construction, matching) operate on the resulting
//! tokens instead of raw text.
//!
//! ## What the lexer understands
//!
//! - **Single quotes** `'...'`: everything inside is literal; there is no
//!   escape mechanism inside single quotes (a backslash is just a backslash).
//! - **Double quotes** `"..."`: literal except for the backslash escapes
//!   POSIX defines inside double quotes — `\"`, `\\`, `\$`, `` \` ``. Any other
//!   backslash is left as a literal backslash (the following character is
//!   read normally on the next iteration). Critically, `\"` does **not**
//!   close the string — only a bare, unescaped `"` does.
//! - **Backslash escapes outside quotes**: `\<char>` is a literal `<char>`,
//!   so `\;` and `\&` are word data, never operators.
//! - **Adjacent-string concatenation**: nothing special is required to
//!   implement this — it falls out of the design. A "word" is a run of
//!   pieces (bare chars, single-quoted regions, double-quoted regions,
//!   escapes, substitutions) with no intervening whitespace; each piece
//!   appends its resolved text to the same word buffer, so `"/e"tc` naturally
//!   becomes the one token `/etc`.
//! - **Command substitution** `$(...)` and backticks `` `...` ``, including
//!   when they occur inside a double-quoted region (real shells still expand
//!   `$(...)` inside double quotes): lexed as a single **opaque** token —
//!   the raw source text is kept (never evaluated), the token's
//!   `has_substitution` flag is set, and — this is the point — any `;`,
//!   `&&`, `||`, `|` inside the substitution's parens/backticks is consumed
//!   as part of the opaque region and never seen as a top-level operator.
//! - **Operator splitting**: unquoted, unescaped `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, a
//!   lone `&` (background), and newlines end the current segment. A
//!   separator character that is quoted, escaped, or inside a substitution
//!   is word data, not a boundary.
//! - **Grouping/compound-command boundaries**: unquoted, unescaped `(`, `)`,
//!   `{`, `}` also end the current segment, exactly like `;` does — a
//!   subshell's or brace-group's contents become their own segment(s) rather
//!   than swallowing the whole construct into one un-`^`-anchorable word
//!   (`( rm -rf / )`, `{ rm -rf /; }` would otherwise put `rm` at argv[1],
//!   never argv[0], and every deny rule is anchored to argv[0]). `${...}`
//!   parameter-expansion syntax is the one carve-out: a `{` immediately
//!   after `$` is not a grouping boundary — real bash doesn't treat it as
//!   one either — so `${HOME}` stays one literal token, matching the
//!   existing `\$\{HOME\}` pack patterns. A leading shell keyword that only
//!   introduces the real command (`then`, `do`, `else`, `elif`) is stripped
//!   from a segment's front so the guarded command lands at argv[0]
//!   (`if true; then rm -rf /; fi` and `for i in 1; do rm -rf /; done` both
//!   judge `rm -rf /`, not `then`/`do`). This is heuristic keyword-stripping,
//!   not compound-statement parsing — see the design doc's "known
//!   limitations" for what a real shell grammar would additionally give.
//! - **`$'...'` ANSI-C quoting**: real bash decodes backslash escapes inside
//!   `$'...'` (`\n \t \r \\ \' \xHH \0NNN`, plus a handful more) rather than
//!   treating the body as literal the way `'...'` does. The lexer decodes
//!   the common escapes so `$'/'` and `$'\x2f'` both resolve to the argument
//!   `/` instead of surviving as unresolved junk. Escapes this lexer does
//!   not know (`\uXXXX`, `\UXXXXXXXX`, `\cX`, `\eE`, …) are kept literally
//!   (backslash + character) rather than guessed at — see "known
//!   limitations".
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! No shell grammar beyond the above: no variable expansion (`$VAR`,
//! `${VAR}` are left as literal, unevaluated text), no glob expansion, no
//! here-docs, no evaluating what a substitution would actually output, and
//! grouping/keyword handling is a boundary heuristic, not a parser for `if`/
//! `for`/`while`/`case` compound-command grammar. See the design doc's
//! "known limitations" for the honest scope.
